# Fivetran Log ([docs](https://fivetran-log-dbt-package.netlify.app/#!/overview))

This package models Fivetran Log data from [our free internal connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/logs/fivetran-log). It uses account-level data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/logs/fivetran-log#schemainformation).

This package helps you understand:
* How you are spending money in Fivetran according to our [consumption-based pricing model](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/consumption-based-pricing). We display consumption data at the table, connector, destination, and account levels.
* How your data is flowing in Fivetran:
    * Connector health and sync statuses
    * Transformation run statuses
    * Daily API calls, schema changes, and records modified
    * Table-level details of each connector sync

The package's main goals are to:
* Create a history of measured monthly active rows (MAR), credit consumption, and the relationship between the two
* Enhance the connector table with sync metrics and relevant alert messages
* Enhance the transformation table with run metrics
* Create a history of vital daily events for each connector
* Create an audit log of records inserted, deleted, an updated in each table during connector syncs

> Note: An earlier version of this package unioned destination-level connector data to the account level. As of [December 2020](https://fivetran.com/docs/logs/fivetran-log/changelog#december2020), the Fivetran Log now supports the creation of account-level connectors. We have removed the Fivetran Log dbt package's unioning functionality and recommend that users resync their Log connectors at the account level.

## Models

| **model**                  | **description**                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [fivetran_log__connector_status](models/fivetran_log__connector_status.sql)        | Each record represents a connector loading data into a destination, enriched with data about the connector's data sync status.                                          |
| [fivetran_log__transformation_status](models/fivetran_log_transformation_status.sql)     | Each record represents a transformation, enriched with data about the transformation's last sync and any tables whose new data triggers the transformation to run. |
| [fivetran_log__mar_table_history](models/fivetran_log__mar_table_history.sql)     | Each record represents a table's active volume for a month, complete with data about its connector and destination.                             |
| [fivetran_log__credit_mar_destination_history](models/fivetran_log__credit_mar_destination_history.sql)    | Each record represents a destination's consumption by showing its MAR, total credits used, and credits per millions MAR.                             |
| [fivetran_log__connector_daily_events](models/fivetran_log__connector_daily_events.sql)    | Each record represents a daily measurement of the API calls, schema changes, and record modifications made by a connector, starting from the date on which the connector was set up.                            |
| [fivetran_log__schema_changelog](models/fivetran_log__schema_changelog.sql)    | Each record represents a schema change (altering/creating tables, creating schemas, and changing schema configurations) made to a connector and contains detailed information about the schema change event.                           |
| [fivetran_log__audit_table](models/fivetran_log__audit_table.sql)    | Replaces the deprecated [`fivetran_audit` table](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/system-columns-and-tables#audittables). Each record represents a table being written to during a connector sync. Contains timestamps related to the connector and table-level sync progress and the sum of records inserted/replaced, updated, and deleted in the table.                             |


## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `fivetran_log` schema. If this is not where your Fivetran Log data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  fivetran_log:
    fivetran_log_database: your_database_name
    fivetran_log_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Disabling Transformation Models
If you have never created Fivetran-orchestrated [basic SQL transformations](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/basic-sql), your source data will not contain the `transformation` and `trigger_table` tables. Moreover, if you have only created *scheduled* basic transformations that are not triggered by table syncs, your source data will not contain the `trigger_table` table (though it will contain `transformation`).

To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the following variable(s) to your `dbt_project.yml` file. By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  fivetran_log:
    fivetran_log_using_transformations: false # this will disable all transformation + trigger_table logic
    fivetran_log_using_triggers: false # this will disable only trigger_table logic 
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Fivetran Log staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_fivetran_log`)  and the Fivetran Log final models within your <target_schema> + `_fivetran_log` in your target database. If this is not where you would like you Fivetran Log staging and final models to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  fivetran_log:
    +schema: my_new_final_models_schema # leave blank for just the target_schema
    staging:
      +schema: my_new_staging_models_schema # leave blank for just the target_schema

```
